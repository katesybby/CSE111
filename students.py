# 09 Team Activity: CSV Files

'''
CORE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Open the students.csv file for reading, skip the first line of text in the file because
it contains only headings, and read the other lines of the file into a dictionary. 
The program must store each student I-Number as a key and each I-Number name pair or 
each name as a value in the dictionary. 

2. Get an I-Number from the user, use the I-Number to find the corresponding student name 
in the dictionary, and print the name.

3. If a user enters an I-Number that doesnâ€™t exist in the dictionary, your program must
print the message, "No such student" (without the quotes).
